      A major issue in the united arab emirates is that food waste costs the uae
      about $3.5billion a year over 3200 tons of food is wasted (3,200,000 kg)


      now this is a problem because people who get less pays  such as blue
      collard workers which finish their jobs at odd times such as 3am  dont
      have energy to cook so we plan to partner with supermarkets and buy
      multiple stock of food near expiry for a significantly cheaper price (we
      plan to get ready meals)

          Sustainability means making sure that our food systems (how we grow,
          produce, and distribute food) are good for the environment, society,
          and the economy. This ensures that future generations will have enough
          food without harming the planet or running out of resources.

      ### 1. Partner with Us


      We collaborate with businesses, malls, and food retailers that have end of
      shelf life profucts at the end of the day. These partners offer us
      discounted prices on items that are still safe to consume, preventing
      perfectly good food from being wasted.




      ### 2. Discounted Bulk Purchase


      We end of shelf life food in bulk at a reduced price. This allows us to
      keep costs low while ensuring that the food remains safe and nutritious
      when placed in our vending machines.




      ### 3. Vending Machine Distribution


      The food is then distributed through strategically placed vending machines
      located in high-traffic areas. These machines are stocked regularly and
      are designed to be easily accessible for people from all walks of life.




      ### 4. Affordable Access for All


      By offering food that are the end of shelf life at lower prices than
      typical supermarkets and retailers, we make sure that everyone, especially
      people from low-income backgrounds, can access nutritious meals. Our goal
      is to keep prices affordable.
