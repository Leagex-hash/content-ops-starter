The UAE has a serious problem with food waste. Every year, a huge amount of food is thrown away, and this causes many problems for the environment, the economy, and society.

#### The Problem

In the UAE, around 3.2 million tonnes of food get wasted every year. That’s like throwing away enough food to fill 64 Burj Khalifas! This wasted food means a lot of money is lost—about AED 13 billion ($3.5 billion) each year. Also, when food gets thrown away, it can harm the environment.

#### Why Is This Happening?

Several things lead to so much food waste in the UAE:

1.  Making Too Much Food: Restaurants, hotels, and even homes often make more food than people can eat, leading to a lot of leftovers that get thrown away.

2.  Throwing Away Good Food: Stores and supermarkets sometimes throw away food that looks a bit old or damaged, even if it’s still safe to eat.

3.  Buying Too Much: People sometimes buy more food than they need, and when it goes bad, they have to throw it away.

4.  Not Knowing: Many people don’t realize how bad food waste is for the environment and how much money it wastes.

#### How to Fix It

People and organizations in the UAE are trying to solve this problem in different ways:

1.  UAE Food Bank: This organization collects extra food from places like hotels and restaurants and gives it to people who need it. This way, less food gets thrown away, and more people get help.

2.  Government Rules: The government is making new rules to help reduce food waste and encourage people to use food more wisely.

3.  Community Help: Groups and organizations are working together to provide food to those in need and raise awareness about not wasting food.

#### Conclusion

Food waste in the UAE is a big problem, but it can be fixed. By being careful about how much food we make and buy, and by supporting efforts to share extra food, we can reduce waste and help the environment and economy. Everyone can play a part in making sure that food is used wisely and not wasted.
