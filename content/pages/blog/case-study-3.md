> Plenty to Go is a company that's making a big difference by partnering with supermarkets to tackle two major issues: food waste and malnutrition. Here's how they're doing it:
>
> #### The Problem
>
> Every year, a lot of food gets thrown away because it's close to its expiration date or has minor imperfections. At the same time, many people, especially those in low-wage jobs, struggle to get enough nutritious food. This leads to both environmental harm and health problems.
>
> #### The Solution
>
> Plenty to Go works with supermarkets to buy food that's nearing its shelf life at a lower price. They then resell this food at an even lower price, making it affordable for everyone, including those who face malnutrition. The best part? They don't make any profit from this; their goal is to help people and reduce food waste.
>
> #### How It Works
>
> 1.  Partnerships with Supermarkets: Plenty to Go forms partnerships with supermarkets to purchase food that would otherwise be thrown away.
>
> 2.  Reselling at Lower Prices: They resell this food at a much lower price, making it accessible to people who need it most.
>
> 3.  No Profit Margin: The company operates on a no-profit model, ensuring that the focus remains on helping people and reducing waste.
>
> #### Impact
>
> By doing this, Plenty to Go helps reduce food waste significantly while providing nutritious food to those who might not be able to afford it otherwise. This approach not only helps the environment but also improves the health and well-being of many individuals.
>
> #### Conclusion
>
> Plenty to Go is a great example of how businesses can make a positive impact on society. By addressing food waste and malnutrition together, they're creating a more sustainable and healthier future for everyone.
